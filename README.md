This is the repository for the files of the recently submitted manuscript entitled: "Accidents waiting to happen” – insights from a simple model on the emergence of infectious agents in new hosts. 
Some guidelines so as to better explain how the files should be used follows:

 There are 2 types of files, the .txt files that contain both the original scripts that run the actual simulation, as well as the output files of each, accompanied by an .R file, used to plot the figures used in the presentation of the results in the article. For each parameter value analysed, there is a corresponding script entitled with the relevant parameter value, in .txt format. Each folder contains the scripts necessary to plot the final version of the respective figure, by downloading the output files and running the R script, you will get the plot as they are in the article.
